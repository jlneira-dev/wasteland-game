## GENERAL IDEA:

Player moves through different rooms and defeats enemies in the rooms by shooting at them. 

The enemies attack the player by moving towards it.

Final room includes bossfight, with ranged enemies instead of melee enemies.

Player loses if all lives lost, wins if defeats final room.
